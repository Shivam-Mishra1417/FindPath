Graph is feasible for orientation

0 -> 1
1 -> 2
1 -> 13
1 -> 14
2 -> 3
3 -> 4
4 -> 5
5 -> 6
6 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 9
9 -> 10
10 -> 11
11 -> 12
11 -> 13
11 -> 14
12 -> 0
13 -> 11
13 -> 1
13 -> 14
14 -> 11
14 -> 1
Proof starts here

Below is the edges direction for reversed graph
0 -> 12
1 -> 0
1 -> 13
1 -> 14
2 -> 1
3 -> 2
4 -> 3
5 -> 4
6 -> 5
7 -> 6
8 -> 7
9 -> 8
10 -> 9
11 -> 10
11 -> 13
11 -> 14
12 -> 11
13 -> 1
13 -> 11
14 -> 1
14 -> 11
14 -> 13
Going for reversed graph traversal

Orientation - Successful
